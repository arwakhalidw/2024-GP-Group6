<h1>Alzheimer's Predictor </h1><br /> <br />
Alzheimer's is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people around the world, therefore in this project we'll develop a robust model using Python, that can predict the likelihood of an individual developing Alzheimer’s disease, then integrate it with our website and ChatGPT, thus contributing and offering a potential solution to the challenges that come with a late diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.
